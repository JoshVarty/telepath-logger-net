telepath-logger-net
===================

A worse version of [Nick Winter's telepath logger](https://github.com/nwinter/telepath-logger/) for Windows.

Currently it only takes screenshots and webcam captures every 60 seconds.

I've had difficulty with webcam captures, and suspect this functionality may not work on other machines.
